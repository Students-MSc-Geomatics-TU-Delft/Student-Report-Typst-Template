# Student Typst Report Template

This is a [Typst](https://typst.app/) template for creating student reports, designed to be easy to use and customise. It was made especially for assignments, projects, or any other academic work.

## What it looks like

You can take a look at the [long example](examples/long/main.pdf) and the [short example](examples/short/main.pdf) to see how the template looks in action. They both have a similar content and structure, but a few differences in the layout.

## How to use it

To use it, you should copy the content of the `template` folder to your own project, and potentially the `other-tools` folder if you want to use it. Then, the examples in the `examples` folder can be used as a basis for your own work.

## Documentation

To learn more about the arguments of the different functions in the template, you can check the [documentation](doc/doc.pdf).

This template is designed to be easy to use but also very customisable. For this, you will need to know a bit about Typst. If you are not familiar with it, you can check the [Typst documentation](https://typst.app/docs/) to learn more about it.

## Issues / Improvements

There are no known issues with the template. However, it is possible that some combinations or arguments don't work well together. If you find any issues, please open an [issue](https://github.com/Students-MSc-Geomatics-TU-Delft/Student-Report-Typst-Template/issues/new) or a pull request. You can also suggest improvements or new features.

Here are some ideas for improvements:

- Usability:
  - Improve the organisation to make the template easier to initialise
  - Register it as a Typst template to get access to the `typst init` command?
- Features:
  - Add more customisation of the header and footer,
  - Add more customisation of the cover page (subtitle, logos, other ideas?),
- Other ideas?
